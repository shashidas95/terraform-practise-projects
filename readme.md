To determine the profiles available in your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`), follow these steps:

---

### **1. Locate the AWS Credentials File**

The credentials file is typically located at `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux/macOS or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` on Windows.

---

### **2. Open the Credentials File**

Use a text editor or terminal command to view the file:

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  cat ~/.aws/credentials
  ```
- **Example Output**:

  ```ini
  [default]
  aws_access_key_id = YOUR_DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY
  aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY

  [dev]
  aws_access_key_id = YOUR_DEV_ACCESS_KEY
  aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_DEV_SECRET_KEY

  [test]
  aws_access_key_id = YOUR_TEST_ACCESS_KEY
  aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_TEST_SECRET_KEY
  ```

In this case, the available profiles are:

- `default`
- `dev`
- `test`

---

### **3. Use the AWS CLI to List Profiles**

You can also list profiles using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure list-profiles
```

#### Example Output:

```bash
default
dev
test
```

---

### **4. Use the Profile Name in Terraform**

Once you identify the profile, update your `provider "aws"` block:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region                  = "us-east-1"
  shared_credentials_files = ["~/.aws/credentials"]
  profile                 = "dev"  # Replace with your profile
}
```

---

If you face issues or have multiple profiles and are unsure which to use, let me know!

Yes, you can change or add profiles in your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`). Here's how to do it:

---

### **Steps to Change/Add a Profile**

#### **1. Open the Credentials File**

Open the `~/.aws/credentials` file with a text editor. For example:

- Using `nano`:
  ```bash
  nano ~/.aws/credentials
  ```
- Or with `vim`:
  ```bash
  vim ~/.aws/credentials
  ```

---

#### **2. Modify an Existing Profile**

Find the profile you want to change and update the `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` values. For example:

```ini
[dev]
aws_access_key_id = UPDATED_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = UPDATED_SECRET_KEY
```

---

#### **3. Add a New Profile**

To add a new profile, append it to the file:

```ini
[new-profile]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_NEW_SECRET_KEY
```

---

#### **4. Save and Exit**

- In `nano`, press `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl + X` to exit.
- In `vim`, type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

---

### **Switching Profiles in Terraform**

After adding or modifying the profile, update your Terraform `provider "aws"` block to use the desired profile:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region                  = "us-east-1"
  shared_credentials_files = ["~/.aws/credentials"]
  profile                 = "new-profile"
}
```

---

### **Verification**

Test the updated or new profile with the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile new-profile
```

- If successful, it will display the account and identity details for the updated profile.

---

Let me know if you face any issues while changing or testing the profiles!
